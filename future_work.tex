\section{Future Work} \label{future_work}

While we made significant progress in this project the final outcome is far from being a finished or even playable game.
In this section we will talk about the steps that are necessary before a version of this prototype can be tested by players, such as giving the NPCs the ability to lie and a concept of searching for additional evidence.\todo{was this a plan}

\subsection{Enhancing Characters}

The decision to use emojis \todo{check word emoji} to represent our characters has served us well.
The characters themselves are, however, still very rudimentary and lack personality.

We would like to add more options to the characters themselves, such as age and occupation, as well as use the already defined traits during the investigation stage.
Trusting characters could reveal information more easily, while others may try to keep secrets.

Using the emojis in a less random and more thought out way would allow us to make relationships between characters more clear.
Characters of one family could, for example, have the same skin colour (in most cases).

Currently we only generate whether two characters are related, we do not specify how.
This might be an area where we could improve, which would allow us to introduce more complex rules and allow for more interesting stories, such as rivaling siblings.

To make character relations more obvious, we would like to change their last names, so that families and married couples have the same name.
