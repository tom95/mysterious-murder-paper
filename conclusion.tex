\section{Conclusion} \label{conclusion}

While our murder mystery generator showed promise with regards for variability in the stories it generated, it became clear that this system fundamentally relies on having a well-thought-out set of rules that requires the involvement of an author.
As such, it will not take the place of authored, linear murder mystery games, but rather provide an option to quickly generate ideas for more elaborate plots or generate puzzles with a small scope that a player should be able to solve within 15 minutes.
The explored approaches of combining the linear logic evaluator as implemented by Ceptre with Monte-Carlo-Tree-Search based artificial agents proved to work well to fulfill this purpose.
