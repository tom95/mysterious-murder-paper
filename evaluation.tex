\section{Evaluation} \label{evaulation}

\subsection{Linear Logic}
While linear logic is more suited to represent real-life situations than classical logic, it showed shortcomings when applied to our domain.
In linear logic all rules are deterministic, meaning every rule has exactly one possible outcome.
There is no possibility for chance.
This forced us to have multiple rules to represent possible different resolutions to some rules.
One example is the rule \lstinline{steal}, which allows an actor to attempt to steal money from another.
There were two possibilities when using this rule: the actor could be successful at stealing or he or she could be caught.
These possibilities should obviously have a different effect on the state of the simulation.
This kind of non-determinism is not supported by linear logic.
To remedy this, we extended our implementation of a linear logic evaluator to support multiple outcomes with authored probability as described in section \ref{own_linear_logic_evaluator}.

Another drawback of linear logic was that it only knows the resources that exist in the current state.
There is no possibility to test for the absence of a given resource.
While this did not pose a significant problem, it made the rule's setup more complex, both in terms of authorship and in terms of computation.
For many predicates we now had to introduce an opposite and manually ensure that the resources always appeared mutually exclusive in the resource state.

For example, our system kept track of which characters in the game were related to each other via the predicate \lstinline{related Character Character'}.
When we introduced a new rule \lstinline{get_married}, we wanted to check that the characters getting married were not related to each other.
As linear logic does not allow this, we had to introduce a new predicate \lstinline{not_related} and make sure to assign exactly one of these two predicated during the generation of the initial state.

\subsection{Authorship and Rule Set}
The rules we used in our test runs generated interesting steps of events, but often lacked interest and the agents often fell back to following the same steps of actions to maximize their reward.
We think that given more time, authors with more experience in story telling would be able to use this kind of system to create a rule set that produces more compelling and varied simulations.
It may be necessary to add more convenience to the pure linear logic system to lower the barrier of entry and 
Further, the resulting outcome may be put into a shape that appears more appealing to players by adding additional flavoring to each rule and dynamically adapting the rendition of sequences of events to the player, for example by making a more insecure character's testimony show this character trait in the way they present the testimony.

\todo{lack of time, not complex enough, not enough variability, sign that base system should be more flexible, authors not in IT may find linear logic confusing, missing unique, complex reasoning / story, flavouring}
\todo{talk a bit about the degree of responsibility when defining the rules of society. maybe mention a balance between what a player can understand based on their own societal experience (which is a lot of what detective work is about after all, right?) and what the author thinks a society should act like}
